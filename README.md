# PivotPaths

PivotPaths is an attempt to recreate Marian Dörk's PivotPaths using an academic dataset gathered from Aminer's Open Academic Graph. Instead of making API calls, we preprocess the data using python locally and use local json files to display data. We've added a feature of random search on the search page to implement the true meaning of "strolling".
